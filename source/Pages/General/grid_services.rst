=====
About
=====

The Grid in general consists of a large number and variety of clusters which are distributed all over the Netherlands and abroad. Grid infrastructures in European member states are organised by means of their own **National Grid Initiatives** (NGIs). SURFsara offers Grid services in collaboration with `Nikhef <https://www.nikhef.nl/>`_ and `RUG-CIT <http://www.rug.nl/society-business/centre-for-information-technology/>`_, and together we form the **Dutch National Grid Initiative** (NGI_NL). 

The Dutch National Grid Initiative provides the Grid infrastructure to scientists affiliated with Dutch universities and other research institutes, and to international research projects that have established agreements with us. 

Grid technology can be used for a variety of purposes and application types, however a subset of the worldwide Grid infrastructure can be dedicated for a specific purpose. For example our `Dutch Grid`_ infrastructure, which consists of a small number of tightly interconnected clusters, operated under the umbrella of NGI_NL, is very potent in enabling *high-throughput processing of large datasets* in a minimum amount of time.

=====================
National and European
=====================

The Dutch National Grid Infrastructure is connected to `EGI`_, the European Grid Initiative, which allows Grid users in the Netherlands and abroad easy access to one another's resources. EGI also supplies central monitoring and security and ensures smooth interoperability of all connected clusters.

About
=====

The `Life Science Grid`_ (LSG) is a network of compute clusters intended specifically for researchers in the life science. The LSG infrastructure consists of a series of connected computer clusters which are placed within the working environment of Life Scientists while being fully managed remotely by experts at SURFsara.
 
Since 2007, SURFsara has placed several powerful computer clusters at the local sites of interested universities. Research institutions in the Netherlands house clusters that are embedded in the international Grid infrastructure. 

========
For whom
========

The Life Science Grid is open to all Life Scientists based in the Netherlands. It accommodates Life Scientists on Dutch universities and medical centers to perform data analysis or other computational work on a variety of scales, from a few occasional analysis runs up to thousands of production jobs continuously, on datasets ranging from a few gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes and beyond. 

The LSG infrastructure is tailored specifically for applications within the life-sciences domain, with features that follow-up on specific difficulties experienced by todayâ€™s Life Scientists. Data and applications can be shared not only among colleagues in your own research lab but also with collaborators at other locations, which is not a trivial thing in highly secured hospital environments. Data may also be secured behind the institute walls if needed.

SURFsara services
*****************


To deploy your production tasks smoothly on the Grid facilities discussed above, our services can be of great value. Our standard Grid services such as the Workload Management System, Compute Elements, Storage Elements, a Logical File Catalog, Virtual Organisation Management Services, and User Interface machines are indispensable for generic use of the Grid infrastructure. Apart from those we have additional services available as an option, that may be beneficial for your type of application. 

Our Grid services provide:

* High-throughput processing nodes for job execution
* Access to scalable :ref:`grid-storage` facilities, disk and tape
* Standard Grid Services like User Interfaces, Brokers, and Virtual Organisation management services
* *Token Pool* Services (:ref:`topos-overview` and :ref:`picas-overview`) for production run logistics, job collection management, monitoring and control
* Virtual filesystem service :ref:`softdrive` for centralized software deployment on distributed systems
* Dedicated *light paths* (`surflichtpaden <https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/surflichtpaden/index.html>`_): we offer support bridging the last mile between the end points and your data sources.
* *Consultancy*: advice and support on getting access, working with Grid certificates, basic job submission, data access methods, best practices, advice on design and optimization of applications for performance improvements, integration with large-scale job-submission frameworks, and international upscaling.
