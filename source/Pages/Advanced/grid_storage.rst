Grid storage

In this page we will talk about the Grid storage facilities, the tools to interact with it and the method to handle data that is stored on tape.

====================
About Grid storage
====================

Each cluster on the Grid is equipped with a Storage Element (SE) where data is stored. The Grid storage is useful for applications that handle large amount of data that can not be sent with the :ref:`job Sandbox <job-lifecycle>` or stored in a :ref:`pilot job database <pilotjob-db>`.

You can interact with the Grid storage from the :abbr:`UI (User Interface)` or from a Worker Node, within your running job. The scripts that can access the Grid storage can be submitted from:

* :ref:`The UI <get-ui-account>`
* :ref:`Any local LSG cluster <lsg-clusters>`
* :ref:`The Dutch Grid <dutch-grid>` 

To use the Grid storage you must:

* Have :ref:`a personal Grid certificate <get-grid-certificate>` [1]_
* Be member of :ref:`a VO <join-vo>` for which we have allocated storage space.

.. [1] It is possible to access the dCache Grid storage without certificate, e.g., by using a web based storage client :abbr:`Webdav (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)` with username/password authentication. However, authentication with username/password is less secure, and is not as fast as other clients. Please see below.


.. _storage-types:

=============
Storage types
=============

There are two storage types available on the Dutch Grid sites: 

* dCache


The storage element located at SURFsara is accessible from *any* Grid cluster or :abbr:`UI (User Interface)`. It uses the `dCache system`_ for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data, distributed among a large number of server nodes. It consists of magnetic tape storage and hard disk storage and both are addressed by a common file system. See :ref:`dCache-specs` for details about our dCache instance.

* DPM
 
 
The storage elements located at the various :ref:`Life Science Grid clusters <life-science-clusters>` are accessible *only* by the :abbr:`LSG (Life Science Grid)` users. The :abbr:`LSG (Life Science Grid)` clusters have local storage that uses DPM (Disk Pool Manager).


.. note:: The :abbr:`DPM (Disk Pool Manager)` storage is only disk storage and does not support tape back-end. In opposite, the dCache central storage has both disk and tape.
.. _storage-clients:

===============
Storage clients
===============

The ``InputSandbox`` and ``OutputSandbox`` attributes in the :ref:`JDL <JDL>` file are the basic way to move files to and from the User Interface (UI) and the Worker Node (WN). However, when you have large files (from about 100 MB and larger) then you should not use these sandboxes to move data around. Instead you should use the :ref:`storage-types` and work with several :ref:`storage-clients`. 
You can access the Grid storage with Grid :ref:`storage-clients`, through interfaces that speak protocols like :abbr:`SRM (Storage Resource Management)`, :abbr:`GridFTP (File Transfer Protocol with Grid authentication)`, :abbr:`GSIdCap (dCache Access Protocol with Grid auhthentication)` or :abbr:`Webdav (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)`. With these storage clients you can:

* list directories and files
* read (download) files
* write (upload) files
* delete files or directories
* :ref:`stage` files (copy them from tape to disk for faster reading)

The common commands for each individual clients are shown in their own sections available through the link in the table below.

.. note:: From the many Grid storage clients, we recommend you to use the :ref:`uberftp`, :ref:`globus` or :ref:`gfal`. These tools have a clean interface, and their speed is much better on our systems compared with their srm-* equivalents.

.. [2] Examples of tape control: staging a file from tape to disk, or get its locality (tape or disk).

.. [3] SRM and LCG commands use the :abbr:`SRM (Storage Resource Management)` protocol for metadata level operations and switch to another protocol like GridFTP for file transfers. This may cause protocol overhead. For example, authentication needs to be done twice: once for each protocol.

.. _file-id:

=====================
Grid file identifiers
=====================

You can refer to your files on the Grid with different ways depending on which of the available :ref:`storage-clients` you use to manage your files: 

Transport URL (TURL) or Storage (SURL)
=====================

For example, the location of a file named *zap.tar* owned by *homer*, who is a member of the VO e.g., *lsgrid*, can be referred to in several ways depending on the storage client and the protocols supported by the client:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	TURLs
	# The GridFTP protocol (default port 2811) on dCache storage (which will be supported multiple clients)
	gsiftp://gridftp.grid.sara.nl:2811/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar

	# same, but with a Webdav TURL protocol
	https://webdav.grid.sara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar
	
	# The GridFTP protocol (default port 2811) on DPM storage at lumc cluster
	gsiftp://gb-se-lumc.lumc.nl:2811/dpm/lumc.nl/home/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar
	
	SURLs
	# SRM protocol (default port 8443) on dCache storage (which will be supported only by the SRM client)
	srm://srm.grid.sara.nl:8443/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar 

        # The GridFTP protocol (default port 2811) on dCache storage (which will be supported multiple clients)
        gsiftp://gridftp.grid.sara.nl:2811/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar
	
	# SRM protocol on DPM storage at lumc cluster
	srm://gb-se-lumc.lumc.nl:8446/dpm/lumc.nl/home/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar 
	
.. topic:: Clients for TURLs

	* uberftp
	* globus
	* gfal
	* fts
	* globusonline
	
.. topic:: Clients for SURLs

	* srm
	* gfal
	* fts
	* lcg-lfn-lfc


Logical File Name (LFN) and Grid Unique Identifier (GUID)
=========================================================

These identifiers correspond to logical filename such as ``lfn:/grid/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar``


.. note:: The :abbr:`SURLs (Storage URLs)` and :abbr:`TURLs (Transport URLs)` contain information about where a **physical** file is located. In contrast, the :abbr:`GUIDs (Grid Unique Identifiers)` and :abbr:`LFNs (Logical File Name)` identify a **logical** filename irrespective of its location. You only need to use these if you work with :ref:`large-data-lfc-practice` on multiple :abbr:`LSG (Life Science Grid)` sites.

.. _staging:

=============
Staging files
=============

The :ref:`dCache` storage at SURFsara consists of magnetic tape storage and hard disk storage. If your :ref:`quota allocation <quotas>` includes tape storage, then the data stored on magnetic tape has to be copied to a hard drive before it can be used. This action is called :ref:`staging` or 'bringing a file online'.

.. table:: Staging terms

  +---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Locality            | Meaning                                                         |
  +=====================+=================================================================+
  | ONLINE              | The file is only on disk                                        |
  +---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NEARLINE            | The file is only on tape; it should be staged before reading it |
  +---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | ONLINE_AND_NEARLINE | The file is both on disk and on tape                            |
  +---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

There are some more file statuses. See the `SRMv2 specifications <https://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/doc/SRM.v2.2.html#_Toc241633052>`_ for a full list.

.. _staging-single-file:

Staging a single file
=====================

.. note:: For the staging examples below, you need a valid proxy, see :ref:`startgridsession`.

Here is an example of how to stage a single file:

.. code-block:: console

	$srm-bring-online srm://srm.grid.sara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/test
	srm://srm.grid.sara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/test brought online, use request id 424966221 to release

Don't use this method to stage multiple files. Use the ``stage.py`` example below instead, because it is much more efficient.

How to display the locality:

.. code-block:: console

	$srmls -l srm://srm.grid.sara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/test | grep locality
	  locality:ONLINE_AND_NEARLINE



.. _staging-group-of-files:

Staging groups of files
=======================

The example below shows how to stage a list of files with known :abbr:`SURLs (Storage URLs)`.

* Copy and untar the tarball :download:`staging scripts </Scripts/staging.tar>` to your :abbr:`UI (User Interface)` home directory.

* Create a proxy on the :abbr:`UI (User Interface)`:

  .. code-block:: console
  
	$startGridSession lsgrid  

* The file paths should be listed in a file called ``files`` with the following format:

  .. code-block:: console

	/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/...

  Let's say that you have a list of :abbr:`SURLs (Storage URLs)` that you want to stage. Convert the list of 
  :abbr:`SURLs (Storage URLs)` in the ``datasets/example.txt`` file to the desired ``/pnfs`` format: 

  .. code-block:: console

	$grep --only-matching '/pnfs/grid.sara.nl.*' datasets/example.txt > files

* Display the locality of the files with:

  .. code-block:: console

	$python state.py


* Stage the files:  

  .. code-block:: console

	$python stage.py

This script stages a number of files from tape. You can change the pin lifetime in the ``stage.py`` script by changing the ``srmv2_desiredpintime`` attribute in seconds.



.. _monitor-staging:

Monitor staging activity
========================

Once you submit your stage requests, you can use the gfal scripts to monitor the status or check the webpage below that lists all the current staging requests:

	http://dcmain.grid.sara.nl:2288/poolInfo/restoreHandler/lazy


.. _unpin-file:

Unpin a file
============

Your files may remain *online* as long as there is free space on the disk pools. When a pool group is full and free space is needed, dCache will purge the least recently used cached files. The tape replica will remain on tape.

The disk pool where your files are staged has limited capacity and is only meant for data that a user wants to process on a Grid site. When you :ref:`pin a file <pin-file>` you set a `pin lifetime`. The file will not be purged until the pin lifetime has expired. Then the data may be purged from disk, as soon as the space is required for new stage requests. When the disk copy has been purged, it has to be staged again in order to be processed on a Worker Node.

When a pool group is full with pinned files, staging is paused. Stage requests will just wait until pin lifetimes for other files expire. dCache will then use the released space to stage more files until the pool group is full again. When this takes too long, stage requests will time out. So pinning should be used moderately.

When you are done with your processing, we recommend you release (or unpin) all the files that you don't need any more. In order to unpin a file, run from the UI:

.. code-block:: console

	$srm-release-files srm://srm.grid.sara.nl:8443/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar # replace with your SURL

This command will initiate unpinning of file ``zap.tar`` (even if you submitted multiple pin requests) and the file will remain cached but purgeable until new requests will claim the available space. It is an optional action, but helps a lot with the effective system usage.

.. warning:: At the moment neither the ``srm-bring-online`` nor the python ``gfal`` scripts can effectively release a file if there are multiple pin requests. Please use ``srm-release-files``.

SRM interaction example diagram
===============================

Here is a sequence diagram that illustrates how the :abbr:`SRM (Storage Resource Manager)` commands interact with the Grid storage.

.. image:: /Images/Using_SRM.png

.. comment: Image source at https://www.websequencediagrams.com/?lz=dGl0bGUgVXNpbmcgU1JNCgpzcm0tYnJpbmctb25saW5lXG5jb21tYW5kIC0-IFNSTVxuZG9vcjogUHJveHkgY2VydGlmaWNhdGUKbm90ZSBvdmVyABsMQXV0aGVudGljYXRpbmcgXG4mIHVzZXIgbWFwcGluZwoASQkgLT4gAGMZOiBZb3UncmUgYQBFCmVkAIEDKXNybUJyaW5nTwCBTQUgPFNVUkw-AIEWGm9yaXplZD8AgTsWUXVldWluZyByZXN0b3JlIG9wZXJhdGlvbgCBIilTdGFnaW5nAIEABywgY2hlY2sgYmFjayBsYXRlcgCCPgsAgXYbV2FpdGluZwCCYBZSAIEYBWluZyBmaWxlAIMrKUlzAIIVByAAg3YGPwCCdSplcywANAhpcwA4BwCESAVjcACDU28AZgsAhB0aAHwac3JtR2V0AIN7KQBhHVVzZSA8VACCTAVmb3IgZG93bmxvYQBtFEdyaWRGVFAAhjkkABwPAIZBIABNDQCCDxQAhxcLAIIHFQCBDA8AghgFAIFPBQB2HgCGPQgAXyFGaWxlIHRyYW5zZmVyCgo&s=roundgreen

As you can see from this diagram, there can be a lot of overhead per file. For this reason, Grid storage performs best with large files. We recommend to store files of several megabytes to gigabytes. Some users have files of more than 2 terabytes, but that may be impractical on other systems with limited space like worker nodes.

===============================
Importing large amounts of data
===============================

The `Data Ingest Service <https://www.surf.nl/en/services-and-products/data-ingest-service/index.html>`_ is a SURFsara service for researchers who want to store or analyze large amounts of data at SURFsara. The service is convenient for users who lack sufficient bandwidth or who have stored their data on a number of external hard disks.

===================
Future developments
===================

SURFsara is working towards better integration between systems. We're currently building what we call the **Central Data Infrastructure**. This will allow users to store their data to be accessible from all SURFsara systems, including the Lisa compute cluster and the Cartesius supercomputer, with the same protocols as the grid storage but also NFS and SCP. A web user interface will allow you to easily share information with other users. The current Central Archive will be assimilated into the :abbr:`CDI (Central Data Infrastructure)`. If you're happy with the current grid storage, you don't have to move your data, because the grid storage will still be supported.
