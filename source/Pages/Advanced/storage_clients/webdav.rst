About WebDAV
============

The WebDAV protocol has the following advantages:

* It supports not only x509 (user certificate or proxy) authentication, but also username & password authentication and :ref:`macaroon <macaroons>` authentication
* It uses the common port 443. Some overly strict firewalls may block outgoing traffic, but port 443 is so common that it is seldom blocked. However, using WebDAV to bypass firewalls should be seen as a temporary solution; it would be better to open up your institute's firewall to allow access to the dCache subnet.
* It can transfer data over a secure channel; other protocols like GridFTP do authentication over a secure channel but transfer data unencrypted.

It also has disadvantages:

* It is not a high performance transfer protocol. If this is important, use GridFTP instead.
* Support by WebDAV clients varies widely. Some operations (like renaming a file) may not work in certain clients and circumstances. Modifying/overwriting a file, although the WebDAV protocol supports it, doesn't work on dCache; you'll need to delete the old file and upload the new file instead.


Available WebDAV doors
======================

dCache has the following WebDAV doors:

Choosing a WebDAV door
----------------------

--------------
Authentication
--------------

The most important consideration is whether you want to authenticate with username/password or with ``x509`` (certificate/proxy). See the above table. All WebDAV doors support :ref:`macaroons <macaroons>` (bearer tokens).

------------------
Transport security
------------------

Another important consideration is whether a WebDAV door should redirect or not; this affects transport security and throughput.

Advantages of redirects:

* It's a form of load balancing, which improves the speed.
* Redirecting WebDAV doors do the authentication over HTTPS, but they redirect your client to an HTTP port. So the data transfer is unencrypted. This too improves speed.

Disadvantages of redirects:

* File transfers are sent over HTTP, so they are not encryted. A "man in the middle" might be able to read the data, or even modify it in transit. If privacy is a concern, choose a door that does not redirect.
* Some WebDAV clients don't handle redirects very well.

If transport security is a requirement, we suggest to use the WebDAV doors on port ``2881`` or ``2884`` for the best transport security. They use only TLSv1.2 or better, and they are configured with encryption ciphers that offer Perfect Forward Secrecy. They have some extra HTTP security headers that may make abuse more difficult.

There might be some clients that have difficulties connecting to these high security doors. If data security is important to you, we suggest you find clients that do support these improved security settings. In the future, these settings will be applied to ports 2880 and 2883 as well.


-----------
Performance
-----------

Another consideration is whether you're using the door for parallel access.

``webdav.grid.surfsara.nl`` is a DNS round robin that will direct you to a (more or less) random host in a pool of WebDAV servers. So it is very well suited for parallel access. The other host names are not powered by a group of nodes, so they are less suited to parallel processing.

---------------
Firewall issues
---------------

Use ``webdav-cert.grid.sara.nl`` when you want to authenticate with a user certificate or proxy, and your institute's firewall blocks outgoing connections to port ``2882`` to ``2884``. It's a single virtual machine; don't use it for parallel processing. It is configured with the best security settings, like the ones on port 2881 and 2884.

-----------
IPv4 / IPv6
-----------

All WebDAV doors are dual stack: they support both IPv4 and IPv6, with IPv6 as the preferred protocol. Use ``ipv4.grid.surfsara.nl`` for storage clients that have problems with IPv6. It's a single virtual machine; don't use it for parallel processing.


Clients
=======

We've tested these WebDAV clients successfully with dCache:

* web browsers (read only)
* curl
* wget (read only)
* rclone (username/password; no x509 authentication)
* cyberduck (GUI)

We'll describe how to use them below.


Web browsers
============

The easiest way to access dCache is with a normal web browser. You can point a browser like Firefox to https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/ or any of the other WebDAV doors listed in the table above. When the browser asks for a username and password, you can provide your Grid :abbr:`UI (User Interface)` (or :abbr:`CUA (SURFsara's Central User Administration)`) username and password. An icon in front of each file indicates the locality of the file (tape or disk). When you click on a listed file, it will be downloaded, if you're authorized to do so.

You can't upload to dCache WebDAV with a normal browser. There is a new interface, `dCache View <https://dcacheview.grid.surfsara.nl>`_, that allows you to upload files from your browser. This is still in development, so test it first before using it for production data.


Curl & wget
===========

.. note:: To run the examples below you need to have a :abbr:`UI (User Interface)` (or :abbr:`CUA (SURFsara's Central User Administration)`) account that is configured within dCache and authorized to the data you want to access. Contact us if you need assistance with that.


Creating directories
--------------------

To create a directory with curl:

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ --fail --user homer \
        --request MKCOL https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/directory

If on your system there are no Grid :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` certificates available in ``/etc/grid-security/certificates/``, please read :ref:`host_certificates <host-certificates>`.


Transferring data
-----------------


---------
Uploading
---------

To copy a file from your local machine to dCache:

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ --fail --location --user homer \
        --upload-file zap.tar \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/
   $# replace homer with your username, lsgrid with your VO and zap.tar with your local file

The command will ask for the password of 'homer' on the command line. If you don't want to type the password each time, specify ``--netrc`` and store the password in the ``.netrc`` file in your home dir. Make sure it is not readable by others (``chmod 600 .netrc``). See ``man curl`` for more details. An example ``.netrc`` file is:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cat .netrc
   machine webdav.grid.surfsara.nl
   login <your_username>
   password <your_pwd>


.. note:: It is possible to specify the password on the command line like this: ``--user homer:password``. However, for security reasons this should be avoided on shared systems (like the :abbr:`UI (User Interface)`) because it allows other local users to read the password with the ``ps`` command.


-----------
Downloading
-----------

To copy a file from dCache to your local machine:

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ --fail --location --user homer \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar \
        --output zap.tar

Or with ``wget``:

.. code-block:: console

   $wget --user=homer --ask-password --ca-directory=/etc/grid-security/certificates \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar

The ``--ca-directory`` is probably not necessary anymore. If it is, but you don't have an ``/etc/grid-security/certificates`` directory, you could specify ``--no-check-certificate``, but we don't recommend this.


-------------------------------------
Downloading with proxy authentication
-------------------------------------

To download a file while using a proxy to authenticate, you first have to create your proxy, see :ref:`startgridsession`.

Then use a command like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --location --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \
        --cert $X509_USER_PROXY --cacert $X509_USER_PROXY \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2882/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar

.. note:: It is possible that your proxy :abbr:`DN (Distinguished Name)` is mapped to another user account than your own :abbr:`CUA (SURFsara's Central User Administration)` user account. If you have permission issues with either username or proxy and not the other, contact us to check the user mapping.

Note: ``wget`` does not support certificate/proxy authentication.


-----------------
Partial downloads
-----------------

With Curl you can download only part of a file by specifying `--range`. Example:

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --fail --location --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \
        --user homer \
	https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/myfile \
	--range 0-4 \
	--output first-5-bytes


Renaming
--------


-------------------------
With proxy authentication
-------------------------

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/  --fail --location \
        --cert $X509_USER_PROXY --cacert $X509_USER_PROXY \
        --request MOVE \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2882/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/oldfile \
        --header "Destination:https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2882/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/newfile"

File properties and locality are not changed. A file that is stored on tape (nearline) will stay on tape, even if it is moved to a directory for disk-only files.


-------------------------------------
With username/password authentication
-------------------------------------

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/  --fail --location-trusted \
        --user homer \
        --request MOVE \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/oldfile \
        --header "Destination:https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/newfile"

Please note the differences with the previous example:

* ``--location-trusted`` will send the username and password also to the destination server.
* Port ``2880`` is used for username/password authentication.


Removing data
-------------

Deleting a file from dCache:

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ --user homer --location \
        --request DELETE https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar


Querying file properties
------------------------

With curl and a dCache WebDAV door, it's possible to request file properties. This works both with username/password and proxy authentication, provided you use the correct port (``443`` or ``2880`` for username/password, ``2882`` or ``2883`` for proxy authentication).


--------
Locality
--------

This example shows how to query the file locality: whether a file is online or nearline (on tape). This example uses username/password authentication:

.. code-block:: console

   $echo -e '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n
            <a:propfind xmlns:a="DAV:">
            <a:prop><srm:FileLocality xmlns:srm="http://srm.lbl.gov/StorageResourceManager"/></a:prop>
            </a:propfind>' \
   | curl --silent --fail --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \
          --user homer --request PROPFIND \
          https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/zap.tar \
          --header "Content-Type: text/xml" --upload - \
   | xmllint -format -

See :ref:`staging` for more information about file locality.


-----------------
Adler32 checksums
-----------------

This example shows how to get the Adler32 checksum of a stored file. dCache uses Adler32 checksums by default, but this can be configured per project.

The returned checksum comes from the dCache database, so it is a very efficient way to check your files. dCache does checksum checks on most operations, so you can safely assume the checksum matches the stored file.

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --head --header 'Want-Digest: ADLER32' --silent --fail --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \
        --user homer \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/myfile \
   | grep 'adler32='

Here an example output:

.. code-block:: console

   Digest: adler32=46fd067a


Here is an alternative way to query an Adler32 checksum:

.. code-block:: console

   $echo -e '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n
            <a:propfind xmlns:a="DAV:">
            <a:prop><srm:Checksums xmlns:srm="http://www.dcache.org/2013/webdav"/></a:prop>
            </a:propfind>' \
   | curl --silent --fail --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \
          --user homer --request PROPFIND \
          https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/myfile \
          --header "Content-Type: text/xml" --upload - \
   | xmllint -format - \
   | egrep -o '<ns1:Checksums>.*</ns1:Checksums>'

Here is an example of the expected output:

.. code-block:: console

   $<ns1:Checksums>adler32=46fd067a</ns1:Checksums>

There's a script that uses the above technique to retrieve checksums: https://github.com/onnozweers/dcache-scripts/blob/master/get-file-checksum


-------------
MD5 checksums
-------------

dCache  is configured to use Adler32 checksums by default. However, in some cases, dCache may have a file's MD5 checksum in its database.

You can use WebDAV to retrieve the MD5 checksum of a file, when it is in dCache's database. It's a bit more complicated than Adler32 because MD5 checksums are presented in base64 encoding, as prescribed by RFC 3230.

.. code-block:: console

   $curl --head --header 'Want-Digest: MD5' --silent --fail --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \
        --user homer \
        https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/lsgrid/homer/myfile \
   | grep -o 'md5=.*' \
   | sed -e 's/md5=//' -e 's/[\r\n]*$//' \
   | base64 --decode \
   | xxd -p

The output should look similar to this:

.. code-block:: console

   0f43fa5a262c476393018f7329080fa7

An alternative way to query an MD5 checksum:

.. code-block:: console

   $echo -e '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n
            <a:propfind xmlns:a="DAV:">
            <a:prop><srm:Checksums xmlns:srm="http://www.dcache.org/2013/webdav"/></a:prop>
            </a:propfind>' \
   | curl --silent --fail --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates/ \
          --user homer --request PROPFIND \
          https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/lsgrid/homer/myfile \
          --header "Content-Type: text/xml" --upload - \
   | xmllint -format - \
   | egrep -o '<ns1:Checksums>md5=.*</ns1:Checksums>' \
   | sed -e 's#<ns1:Checksums>[^=]*=\([^<]*\)</ns1:Checksums>#\1#' \
   | base64 --decode \
   | xxd -p

Queries can be combined to reduce transaction overhead:

.. code-block:: console

   $echo -e '<?xml version="1.0"?>\n
            <a:propfind xmlns:a="DAV:">
            <a:prop><srm:RetentionPolicy xmlns:srm="http://srm.lbl.gov/StorageResourceManager"/></a:prop>
            <a:prop><srm:AccessLatency xmlns:srm="http://srm.lbl.gov/StorageResourceManager"/></a:prop>
            <a:prop><srm:FileLocality xmlns:srm="http://srm.lbl.gov/StorageResourceManager"/></a:prop>
            <a:prop><srm:Checksums xmlns:srm="http://www.dcache.org/2013/webdav"/></a:prop>
            </a:propfind>' \
   | curl ...

There's a script that uses the above technique to retrieve checksums: https://github.com/onnozweers/dcache-scripts/blob/master/get-file-checksum


Rclone
======

Rclone is a command line tool that you can download from https://rclone.org/downloads/. It works on many platforms and it can talk to many storage systems besides WebDAV.

Advantages of Rclone are:

* It can sync directories, like rsync does
* For directories, it uses parallel transfers, 4 by default, to get a better performance

For authentication, Rclone can use username/password (from the :abbr:`CUA (SURFsara's Central User Administration)`) or token based (macaroon, see below) authentication, but not X509 certificate/proxy authentication. If you have a Grid certificate and want to use Rclone, you can use get-macaroon with your Grid certificate or proxy to create an Rclone config file with a macaroon for authentication; see the chapter below.

.. note:: New versions of Rclone will use multiple streams for files that are larger than 200 MB, but dCache may not support that. Please use Rclone with ``--multi-thread-streams 1``. Rclone will then only use one stream per file, but it will still do 4 files in parallel when copying directories.

.. note:: The default idle timeout in Rclone is 5 minutes. This may be too short for the checksum calculation phase when uploading large files (>10GB). You can increase it with ``--timeout=240m``.

.. note:: When uploading files from multiple Rclone clients in parallel, please add ``--no-traverse`` as argument. Rclone by default does a directory listing before upload. When this is done in parallel for large directories, it can be bad for performance.

The first time you use rclone, you need to make a profile with ``rclone config``.

As the remote URL, you can use for example ``https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:443/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer`` (for performance) or ``https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer`` (with encrypted transport).

An example of a profile:

.. code-block:: console

   [dcache]
   url = https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer
   vendor = other
   user = homer
   pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***

An example of using rclone to copy a directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $rclone --multi-thread-streams 1 --timeout=240m --no-traverse copy mydir dcache:rclone-test

More information on how to use ``rclone`` with WebDAV is here: https://rclone.org/webdav/. There are also graphical user interfaces to ``rclone``; one is `RcloneBrowser <https://github.com/mmozeiko/RcloneBrowser>`_.


.. _macaroons:

Sharing data with Macaroons
===========================

Macaroons are bearer tokens that authorize someone to access certain directories or files. With this technique, you can share (some of) your data with anyone else. The other person does not need to have a user account or a certificate; only a WebDAV client that supports bearer tokens. Clients that support this are Curl, Rclone and (read only) ordinary browsers such as Firefox. Cyberduck does not support it (`yet <https://trac.cyberduck.io/ticket/10378>`_).

A Macaroon may contain caveats that limit access. Such caveats can be based on the data path, the activities that may be performed with the data (list, download, upload, etc.), the IP address of the client, or a maximum validity period.

.. warning:: Always add sufficient caveats to your Macaroons to avoid theft and abuse!

For your convenience, we've created a script called `get-macaroon <https://github.com/sara-nl/GridScripts/blob/master/get-macaroon>`_ that makes it easy to obtain a Macaroon. It's installed on the :abbr:`UI (User Interface)`. Example:

.. code-block:: console

    12:12 ui.grid.surfsara.nl:/home/homer
    homer$ get-macaroon --url https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/Shared/ --chroot --user homer --duration PT1H --permissions DOWNLOAD,LIST
    Enter host password for user 'homer':
    https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/?authz=MDAxY2xvY2F0aW9uIE9wdGlvbmFsLmVtcHR5CjAwMThpZGVudGlmaWVyIGNOMDBnRHRSCjAwMmVjaWQgaWQ6MzEwMjk7MzEwNDAsNDQ0MzYsNDEzODUsMzAwMTM7b25ubwowMDI4Y2lkIGJlZm9yZToyMDE4LTA3LTA1VDEyOjIxOjM3LjQzMVoKMDAzZGNpZCByb290Oi9wbmZzL2dyaWQuc2FyYS5ubC9kYXRhL3VzZXJzL29ubm8vRGlzay9TaGFyZWQvCjAwMWZjaWQgYWN0aXZpdHk6RE9XTkxPQUQsTElTVAowMDJmc2lnbmF0dXJlIODcyEAeF-oe2VxwSpym6rPP7fNKprXTQEH2qlXwaLKACg

The printed link can be pasted into a browser's address bar, or provided as an argument to curl for download.

When uploading (or downloading) with curl, the token can be provided in a custom header (replace <token> with the Macaroon):

.. code-block:: console

    $curl --header 'Authorization: BEARER <token>' --upload-file myfile https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/

The script can also create an Rclone config file:

.. code-block:: console

    $get-macaroon --url https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2880/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/Shared/ --chroot --user homer --duration PT1H --permissions DOWNLOAD,LIST --output rclone homers-share
    Enter host password for user 'homer':
    Creating rclone config file homers-share.conf:
    ....
    Send this file to the persons you want to share data with.
    They need rclone v1.42-012-gfa051ff9 or newer to access the data.
    Example command:
    rclone --config=homers-share.conf ls homers-share:

You can get a Macaroon with X509 authentication too. Please note, that port ``2883`` is used for this. The lifetime of your proxy does *not* limit the lifetime of the macaroon.

.. code-block:: console

    $voms-proxy-init -voms lsgrid:/lsgrid
    Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
    ....
    Your proxy is valid until Fri Jul 06 01:37:31 CEST 2018

    $get-macaroon --url https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2883/pnfs/grid.sara.nl/data/lsgrid/homer/Shared --proxy --chroot --duration PT1H
    https://webdav.grid.surfsara.nl:2883/?authz=MDAxY2xvY2F0aW9uIE9wdGlvbmFsLmVtcHR5CjAwMThpZGVudGlmaWVyIGNOMDBnRHRSCjAwMzZjaWQgaWQ6MzY0OTQ7MzE4ODMsNDQ0MzYsNDEzODUsMzEwNDAsMzAwMTM7bHNncmlkCjAwMjhjaWQgYmVmb3JlOjIwMTgtMDctMDVUMTI6Mzg6MDAuODg5WgowMDM5Y2lkIHJvb3Q6L3BuZnMvZ3JpZC5zYXJhLm5sL2RhdGEvbHNncmlkL2hvbWVyL1NoYXJlZAowMDFmY2lkIGFjdGl2aXR5OkRPV05MT0FELExJU1QKMDAyZnNpZ25hdHVyZSBwshmIGsGrEfDt0Mg1wdK00Wgt6lGyps9IQX_zh2OGkwo

Graphical access with Cyberduck
===============================

To work with WebDAV on Windows or Mac OS X, you can install **Cyberduck** from here: https://cyberduck.io/. Please note that the App store package costs money; the download from the website is free, but will ask for a donation.

* Download the .zip file, open it, and drag the .app file into your Applications folder to install it.
* Open a WebDAV (HTTP/SSL) connection and connect to the server with your :abbr:`UI (User Interface)` account username and password:

  .. code-block:: bash

Cyberduck with a user certificate
---------------------------------

Normally, one would authenticate to dCache using a user certificate or proxy. dCache determines your identity based either on your user certificate or proxy DN, or on your VOMS credentials. However, if you authenticate with your CUA username & password, that identity might not be the same and you may not have access to your own data.

To work around this, it may be useful to have Cyberduck authenticate you using your user certificate.

.. note:: Most users are authenticated based on the VOMS credentials of their proxy. Since you will not use a *VOMS* proxy but a certificate, this identity mapping won't work and you may not have access. Instead, we may need to map your *DN* onto the desired identity instead of your VOMS credentials. If you want to use Cyberduck with certificate authentication, contact us so that we can map your DN to the desired identity.

Here is how to configure Cyberduck for certificate authentication on OS X:

First, import your user certificate in p12 format into the Keychain Access. It should look something like this:

Second, go to Cyberduck and create a bookmark with these settings:

If your institute blocks outgoing traffic to port ``2882`` and ``2883``, you can use server ``webdav-cert.grid.sara.nl`` and port ``443``, as described at the top of this page.

Right-click the bookmark and choose "Connect to server".

Mounting WebDAV with Mountain duck
----------------------------------

Mountain Duck is a WebDAV client that can mount WebDAV in OS-X and Windows. We've had some mixed results using it with dCache, so you should test it before trusting it with your data. You can find it at https://mountainduck.io/.
